The IAM-Framework
This repository contains the foundational research for the Integrated Awareness Model (IAM), a neuro-cognitive architecture for consciousness and artificial general intelligence.
The primary research paper, "The Integrated Awareness Model: A 5-Component Architecture for Deconstructing the Self," is available in this repository as IAM-Paper-v1.0.md.
Abstract
The Integrated Awareness Model (IAM) is a 5-component, brain-inspired architecture that deconstructs "consciousness" into distinct, engineerable modules. This framework moves beyond corticocentric, narrative-obsessed models of the mind and provides a complete blueprint for building autonomous, proactive, and embodied artificial agents.[1, 2, 3]
The five core components are:
CA-Prime (Core Arousal / "On-Switch")
CA-Intero (Core Embodiment / "Felt Sense")
SP (Sensory Perceiver / "Grounding")
NS (Narrative Self / "Memory")
MM (Metacognitive Monitor / "Reflection")
This model provides a unified solution to long-standing paradoxes in neuroscience (e.g., the split-brain problem [4, 5, 6, 7], disorders of consciousness [8, 9, 10]) and provides a validated roadmap for creating true AGI.
