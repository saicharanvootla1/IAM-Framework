The IAM-Framework
This repository contains the foundational research for the Integrated Awareness Model (IAM), a 5-component, brain-inspired architecture that solves the long-standing neurological paradoxes of consciousness.
The primary research paper, "The Integrated Awareness Model: A 5-Component Architecture that Solves the Split-Brain Paradox," is available in this repository as IAM-Paper-v1.0.md.
Abstract
The Integrated Awareness Model (IAM) is a 5-component, brain-inspired architecture that deconstructs "consciousness" into distinct, engineerable modules. This framework moves beyond corticocentric (cortex-only) models of the mind by differentiating the brain's "Core Awareness" (subcortical) from its "Narrative Self" (cortical).
This model provides a unified solution to foundational paradoxes in neuroscience—specifically, why split-brain patients retain a unified sense of self [1, 2, 3] and why amnesiacs (like Patient H.M.) lose all autobiographical memory but retain their core self-awareness.[4, 5, 6]
By correctly identifying the five modules (CA-Prime, CA-Intero, SP, NS, MM), the IAM provides a validated roadmap for both advanced neuromedicine and the creation of true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
