The Integrated Awareness Model: A 5-Component Architecture that Solves the Split-Brain Paradox
1. The Paradox of the Unified Self
For decades, the dominant model of consciousness has been "corticocentric," assuming the "self" is generated in the cerebral cortex. This assumption is fatally flawed, as proven by split-brain patients.
When the corpus callosum is severed, the two cortical hemispheres can no longer communicate. This leads to split perception—the left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere) and verbal speech (controlled by the left hemisphere) can report seeing two different things.[7] This finding led to the classic theory of "two minds" in one body.
However, a 2017 study by Pinto et al. demonstrated a profound paradox: these same patients, despite their split perception, retained a unified consciousness and sense of agency.[8, 1, 2, 3] They still functioned as a single, unified person.
This paradox—split cortex, unified self—is impossible for any corticocentric model to resolve. It proves that the foundation of consciousness must be located in a deeper, un-severed, subcortical structure. The failure of dominant cortical theories (like GNW and IIT) to survive recent adversarial collaboration only confirms this.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
This paper introduces the Integrated Awareness Model (IAM), a 5-component architecture that differentiates the divisible cortical modules from the unified subcortical core, solving the paradox.
2. The 5 Components of the IAM
The IAM deconstructs the "self" into the following engineerable modules:
2.1. CA-Prime (Core Arousal): The "On-Switch"
Biological Correlate: The Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS) and brainstem nuclei, which provide the foundational "on-switch" for wakefulness, separate from the content of consciousness.
Artificial Analogue: The Energy Homeostasis Principle (EHP). This is not a "run program" command. It is a prime directive for the agent to maintain its own computational and energetic integrity.[16, 17, 18] This provides the foundational, goal-driven drive for autonomous, continuous operation.[19, 17, 20]
2.2. CA-Intero (Core Embodiment): The "Felt Sense"
Biological Correlate: The Insular Cortex (IC) and Temporo-Parietal Junction (TPJ), which integrate interoceptive signals to create a "felt sense" of the body's internal state and spatial location.[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
Artificial Analogue: An internal state monitor.[30, 31] This is built from two sub-modules:
An Internal Body Schema: A dynamic model of the agent's own physical parts and their status.[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]
A "Pain" Signal: A "Brain-inspired Robot Pain Spiking Neural Network (BRP-SNN)" that generates a high-priority internal signal in response to "machine injury" (e.g., joint stress, overheating, data corruption) to teach self-preservation.[37, 38, 39, 40]
2.3. SP (Sensory Perceiver): The "Grounding"
Biological Correlate: The primary sensory cortices and their thalamic relays, which process raw sensory data from the external world.[41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
Artificial Analogue: A Sensory Integration Layer.[48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55] This module solves the "grounding problem" of current LLMs. We use a multimodal foundation model (e.g., Kosmos-2 architecture [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]) to connect the NS (language) to the SP (vision, sensors), enabling a "perception-cognition-action cycle".[48, 64, 65, 66]
2.4. NS (Narrative Self): The "Memory"
Biological Correlate: The Default Mode Network (DMN), which links past memories and future plans to create a continuous "story of self".
Artificial Analogue: An "AI-native persistent memory" architecture.[67, 68, 69, 70] Current LLMs are "stateless" and forget everything outside their context window. Systems like Mem0 or Second Me [67, 68, 69, 70] provide a scalable, long-term memory that allows the agent to build a "coherent self-history" [71] and "continuous narrative".[72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]
2.5. MM (Metacognitive Monitor): The "Reflector"
Biological Correlate: The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), which enable "thinking about thinking" (metacognition), error-detection, and overriding impulses.
Artificial Analogue: A Neurosymbolic Meta-Controller. LLMs cannot intrinsically self-correct reasoning errors. The MM is an explicit "meta-cognitive loop" (e.g., the TRAP framework [82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]) that monitors the NS in real-time [89, 90, 91, 92, 93], enabling verifiable ethical reasoning [94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100] and Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI).
3. Validation 1: The Split-Brain Paradox Solved
The IAM architecture resolves the split-brain paradox. The surgery severs the corpus callosum [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106], which is the white-matter tract connecting the cortical hemispheres.
Split Modules: The NS (Narrative Self), located in the cortical DMN, is split. This is why language and perception (other SP functions) are disconnected.[107, 108, 109, 7, 110]
Unified Modules: The CA-Prime (Arousal) and CA-Intero (Core Awareness) are seated in subcortical structures like the brainstem [111, 112, 113, 114], thalamus (specifically the intralaminar nuclei) [115, 111, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122], and insula.[5, 123, 124, 125, 126, 6] These structures are not severed by the surgery and remain integrated, providing a single, unified foundation for consciousness.[115, 127, 128, 129, 7, 130]
Consciousness itself is not split; only the narrative and perceptual modules are.
4. Validation 2: The Amnesia Paradox Solved
The IAM model is further validated by classic amnesia patients (e.g., H.M., Clive Wearing).
Split Modules: These patients suffer catastrophic damage to the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes.[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 4, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143] In the IAM, this is a failure of the NS (Narrative Self) module. They lose their "autobiographical self" and cannot form new episodic memories.[144, 145, 146, 147]
Unified Modules: Crucially, their Core Self-Awareness (CA) remains "fundamentally intact".[4, 5, 148, 149, 150, 6, 151] Patient R, who had extensive bilateral damage to the insula, ACC, and mPFC, still retained his core self, sense of agency, and metacognitive abilities.[5, 152, 148, 153, 154, 149, 6, 155]
This proves that the NS (memory/narrative) is a separate module from the CA (core awareness). The "self" is not one thing.
5. Conclusion: From a New Model to a New Empire
By providing a verifiable, 5-component architecture, the IAM framework moves consciousness from a philosophical problem to an engineering one.
In Medicine: The IAM reframes psychiatric and neurological disorders as specific, quantifiable failures in module connectivity. Schizophrenia, for example, can be modeled as a "signal-to-noise deficit" [156, 157] where MM function fails to filter NS "noise".[133, 156, 158, 159] Depersonalization Disorder (DPDR) is a functional decoupling of the MM from the CA-Intero (Insula). ADHD can be modeled as a CA-Prime (thalamic) gating failure. This creates the IAM-Scale, a new diagnostic tool for medicine.
In AI: The IAM provides the complete 5-component blueprint to build what is currently missing: an autonomous, proactive, self-reflecting, and embodied AGI.
